# FestivalTheme
Gama(AI Agent Development Tool)

The main goal of this project was to implement a festival theme with additional functionalities. We have five different 
types of agents in this theme-Guests who wander around the festival, thief who steals the money from the guest, guards who
catches the thief, artists who perform at random locations and janitors who are responsible for cleaning the junk caused by
the guest. We also have a Foodstore where the guests can go in case they are hungry, Drinkstore where the guests go in case
they are thirsty, an Information Centre to help the guests when they donâ€™t know the location and we have species Trash which
represents the junk thrown by the guest when they are drunk.
We also have a species Building to monitor the capacity of guests in each of the stores. In case the number of guests in a
particular store is equal to the maximum capacity, the Guests are made to wait in a Queue until someone leaves the 
store. We have an attribute called Global Happiness to measure the overall happiness of all the guests depending on how 
the Guests interact with each other. The code was written using Belief-Desire-Intention(BDI) Architecture.
